This app was made without a tutorial, so essentially this was my very first app 
by myself.
The purpose of this app was to utilize what I learned from creating the previous apps,
and apply it into my own creation.

This app is a simple rock, paper, scissors game.
The JAVA code for the game is very simple: the player picks either Rock, Paper, or 
Scissors, while a random number is generated for the computer. 
Using simple "if/else" statements, the code decides who wins and who loses.

Again, very simple, but while the game code itself was easy, there was also the new experience
of creating an appealing UI as well as connecting the front-end XML to the back-end code, and then
testing it out on my phone.

While the multiplayer experience is still being developed, the "Player vs. CPU" experience is
running correctly. 

While this app is very simple, I am still proud of getting this to work as intended.

Update as of 12/17/2018: now working to imporve upon what I've learned and implement multiplayer
                         and push it to the app store as a free app.
                        Bump.
