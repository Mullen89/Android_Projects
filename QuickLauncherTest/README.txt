This app was also created using a tutorial. This app taught me three primary
uses for apps:
            1 - How to access another screen in an app.
            2 - How to access another app from within this app.
            3 - How to access a URL from within this app (in this case, Google.com).

Other than that, this app is pretty basic, but it did a very good job of teaching
me some very basic, but useful principals in Android app creation.
