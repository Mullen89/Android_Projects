This is the source code for the very first Android app I ever made.
It only includes the source code, not the gradle or build library files.

This was made primarily so i could learn how to access/put an app on my phone
instead of using the Android Sudio virtual emulator.

There really isn't much with this one, as it's just a test application,
but it does have a smiley face, so there's that at least. :)
